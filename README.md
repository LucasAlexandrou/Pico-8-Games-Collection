# Pico-8 Games Collection

A collection of small games that I have created using **Pico-8**.
Both of these projects focus on the style and feel of an arcade game.

To try out these games yourself they can either be downloaded or even easier, you can play them straight from your browser on my itchio page:
[Itchio](https://lethaldawg.itch.io) or on my lexaloffle page: [Lexaloffle](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?uid=99833). If you own Pico-8 you can also play them straight through that using the .p8.png files
